After a short wait we were shown to our table and given menus. There were a lot of items on the menu, many pretty similarish. I ended up getting a naga mixed chicken and sirloin sizzler which included pasta, vegetables and a peppercorn sauce. The meal arrived piping hot, but I couldn't wait and burnt my mouth several times! The meat was delicious, cooked perfectly, spicy and absolutely hit the spot. The dish was big, and I mean big, so much so that we couldn't finish our meals.

From start to finish was a nice evening. Even tho it was packed out. Managed to fit 4 in. Ordered the sirloin strips with chips. Had it at medium chilli strength. And Damn that Sauce is Hot. Wonder what the HOT HOT sauce strength is like. But have to admit that the quality on the meat and the rest of the food was absolutely spot on. Real tasty it was apart from the Hot sauce. Should order mild next time. Waiter kept checking up on us which was nice even tho the place was packed out. So definitely will be visiting again next time I am in Oldham.
