We didn't expect the unique selection of bakes that are available. We got the Matilda cake which was really nice and not sickly or overly sweet at all. I would recommend the Naga chicken loaded fries they were delicious. We weren't too keen on the chicken burger but the beef sliders were really tasty as was the Korean potato and cheese dog. The selection of drinks was impressive and we all loved our drinks! Bathroom was clean and very aesthetic. Prices here were a little dear but this wouldn't stop me from returning as the service was great too!", "languageCode": "en"}, "originalText": {"text": "Really enjoyed our lunch at Wonderlust bistro.

And being a lover of French toast I thought I should come and try it out with my partner and baby. There was plenty of seating and plenty of baby seats if required. As my daughter was asleep when we arrived the lady that greeted us gave us a table with plenty of space for the push chair. They have a 2 menus to choose from, so I chose the Philly cheese steak and the other half went for the chicken katsu curry. Both were nice but then came the wonderlust French toast that was out of this world. Nice and soft on the inside and just a little bit of crunchyness on the outside. Staff were brilliant. Would definitely go back again. Fully halal too.", "languageCode": "en"}, "originalText": {"text": "Came here after a recommendation from a family member who said their French toast was out of this world.
