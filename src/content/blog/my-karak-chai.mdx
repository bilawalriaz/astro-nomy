From the moment I stepped in, I was mesmerized by the beautiful decor and Instagramable spots throughout the restaurant.\n\nThe food was an absolute delight! The Aloo Paratha was perfectly cooked, and the Gold Gappay were a unique and delightful appetizer. The Halloumi Fries were a revelation - crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, they were a treat for the taste buds. The Karachi Biryani was packed with authentic flavors, and the aroma alone made my mouth water. The Samosa Chaat was a heavenly fusion of flavors, and the Gulab Jamun was the perfect sweet ending to the meal. Oh, and I can't forget the Churros! They were simply amazing, and the dipping sauce complemented them perfectly.\n\nApart from the culinary delights, the atmosphere was warm and friendly, making the dining experience even more enjoyable. The staff was attentive and accommodating, ensuring that every need was met promptly.\n\nI am truly impressed by this restaurant and can't wait to return.

I thanked the universe that the aroma of the food did actually pay off.\n\nOn taste: The flavours were on point and closest to our desi ones. The daal had a nice tasty kick to it and coupled with pickle it was just the most wholesome bite. The egg omelette was great but I used extra seasoning for my liking. Nevertheless, it was the better version of desi omelette than any other place I have been to.\n\nThe Cha was top notch and went perfectly with the Nashta. I couldn\u2019t drink more or I\u2019d have ordered another cup. All I\u2019m saying is the food is top- notch and the serving is BIG.\n\nMy only criticism is the bathroom, which could be more clean but this is for all the restaurants I have seen around England of similar stature.", "languageCode": "en"}, "originalText": {"text": "What an absolute pleasure to have visited this place.
