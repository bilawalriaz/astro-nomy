I've noticed Hungry Adams every time I visit Oldham but never tried it. This time, we decided to because we felt like having a burger. The place is pretty spacious with a few good size tables and booths. We ordered a burger meal each, BBQ ribs, and spicy wings. One thing to look out for, the pictures don't match what you'll get, and the name of the meal won't necessarily tell you what you'll get as well. We ordered the hot fillet burger thinking it's a breaded fillet but it turned out to be a peri peri fillet, we didn't want to be a pain but we were really looking forward to the burger. Credit to the Hungry Adams family, they kindly replaced our burgers with the ones we actually wanted. We were so grateful. They even cut the burger for you, which is so handy. The food tasted good and the price was fair. Would definitely recommend and would go again.", "languageCode": "en"}, "originalText": {"text": "Went out to get something to eat after Eid with my sister and cousins.
