title: "Costa Coffee"
description: "We really enjoy visiting this Costa as it's generally not too busy, allowing us to relax and enjoy our drinks without feeling claustrophobic. The music is pleasant and doesn't interfere with conversation. Although the food selection may not be extensive, they cater well for families with young children. Despite a few hiccups in service, we find this place welcoming and worth visiting for its unique ambiance and history."
