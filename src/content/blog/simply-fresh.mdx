But not anymore.\n\nI ordered a chicken fillet burger and a tray of donner to eat inside. Sat for 40 minutes wondering where the food was. Turned out the guy (wearing red t shirt with pizza written on it) who took my order completely forgot and apologised when i asked, fair enough mistakes happen. Then he gave me the food 5 minutes after i complained, which was a bjt too quick, then i find out why - it was dry and lukewarm. There is absolutley nothing worse than a dry chicken burger. It got stuck in my throat i couldnt even finish it. I think it was somebody elses order from a takeaway? Whatever it was, it clearly wasn't \"simply fresh\" the only reason i come here is so i know its cooked fresh unlike other chicken places where its done in batches and you are gambling on freshness.\n\nThe other issue is the burgers are much much thinner than they used to be. Possibly half what they used to be.  So i can't recommend it any more.  Lower quality, less value for money compared to georgias/floridas or oldham star next door. And thinner burgers go cold and dry out much quicker.\n\nThirdly there Are flies everywhere in the seating area literally landing on tables and the food if you don't bat them away. They need a system to deal with this.\n\nPlus side - they are very friendly staff, and the owner is a very nice guy. But they need to make some improvements.", "languageCode": "en"}, "originalText": {"text": "This place has seriously gone down hill.\n\nThis used to be one of my favourite chicken places in oldham.
