description: "Royal Peri Peri offers delicious, juicy grilled chicken with a side of crispy chips and their addictive house sauce. Their platters are perfect for sharing, and the staff is very friendly. While their service can be slow at times, the quality of their food makes it worth the wait. If you're in Oldham or love Portuguese cuisine, this is the place to be!"
