The mests are very flavoursome and they're not dry like some other places. The prices are reasonable and it's definitely worth the money. Chips taste nice too and you get a good selection of 3 sauces which is a nice added extra. Didn't have to wait a long time to get my food either. I'd buy my Donner from here any day rather than the cheaper takeaways nearby. The salad and sauce that comes on the Wrap is also very tasty!
