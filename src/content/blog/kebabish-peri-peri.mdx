Their mixed kebab is probably one of the best things I've had in a long long while; made up of lamb tikka, chicken tikka and a seekh kebab on naan, it was cooked to perfection and tasted amazing.  The service levels are also really good. We went in when there seemed to be about 10 birthdays going on, with barely a table available, yet the staff still managed to look after us. Amazing and highly recommended.\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW:\nFirst thing to note is that the menu is bigggg. There's literally tons to choose from - almost overwhelmingly so. Anyhow we ordered a chicken shashlik, chicken karahi and a chicken sizzler. By and large a pretty decent meal although the shashlik was not to my taste with whole onion and pepper pieces, and flavourless chicken all covered in some sort of red paste.\n\nNonetheless, I would go again. Fantastic staff that looked after us very well, decent prices and food came quickly. The restaurant was clean and there was also a small car park.", "languageCode": "en"}, "originalText": {"text": "UPDATE SEPTEMBER 2022:\nHaving been a few times now, and having sampled more of the restaurant food and service, I am compelled to update my review.\nThis restaurant is now on my regulars list.
