The friendly staff, including Mehbooba, and the karak chai are noteworthy highlights. However, be aware of potential extra charges for omelette toppings and tea, as well as inconsistent food quality."

Now the omelette is a plain omelette and they asked what did we want on the omelette and so they gave us a few options like tomato, cheese and onion\u2026issue is though, they don\u2019t tell you that it is an extra charge and how much it would be and every topping has a cost. I can understand that but it would be nice if they tell the customer as someone not knowing how these things work would be scared or embarrassed to say something or ask them why there is extra charges on their bill.\nBut the reason why I give them 1 star is because the food was not up to standard as the parata was burned and when we told the staff, they did change it but then the sausage that comes with the breakfast was also burned and rock hard. Now I could have said can you change that also but my question is, how do they let that come out like that? Should they not be checking the food before giving it to the customer? After all, how many items would I be changing?\nThey also don\u2019t tell you that the tea doesn\u2019t come with the breakfast like most places do and they charge extra for it, so to say I can recommend will be far from it. If anyone does go, you need to be aware of these things as they won\u2019t tell you and someone on a budget might struggle.
