I saw the prices and they wasn't cheap however because it was recommended and claimed to be very good I thought why not. How wrong was I..... for a pizza place that has been open this long you would thing they have mastered tge art of not making raw pizzas , I learnt this making pizzas at home and after 3-4 mistakes I haven't made it again but Charging top money for a raw dough pizza is unacceptable. Clearly the dough was not proofed (kneaded and left to sit for a few hours to rise) this part was clearly skipped and tge dough is not pizza flour to cut corners and keep cost low. The thing is this was not a mistake,  they knew this and still felt its acceptable to sell this. I had 2 slices and couldn't eat the rest of the dough so had to scrape tge tiny amount of topping of ,rolled it in a ball and eat it. Definitely would go again and wish I read the reviews\n\nUpdate : my review cannot be seen...why?", "languageCode": "en"}, "originalText": {"text": "VERY VERY VERY disappointed,  I travelled to this place after watching a YouTube review and thought nothing can go wrong, I got there and was welcomed and the customer service was EXCELLENT ,very nice and kind brothers here.
