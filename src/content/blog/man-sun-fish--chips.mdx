title: "Man Sun Fish & Chips"
description: "Based on these reviews, this food business offers a mix of experiences - while some customers enjoyed well-seasoned and satisfying meals, others encountered poor customer service, unappetizing food quality, and an overall unpleasant atmosphere. Despite its flaws, it still has loyal patrons who appreciate the establishment's efforts."

The fish smelt like dead mice and the chips were cold and soggy. I felt really upset about it as I only had 30 mins for lunch. I complained and asked for the food to be replaced or refunded due to the sub zero quality of food. I was then told the food couldn't be changed bec the chef was currently going for his break and he wouldn't be back until another hour so they were going to close the shop for the hour. I then requested to be refunded but was denied that too as according to the staff member I was apparently lying even after showing them and asking them to inspect the food for themselves. I was really frustrated because I was being called a liar when yet I was holding the evidence in my hand. We couldn't come to an agreement and as the arguing got to a boiling point I believe the manager/owner shouted the f word and told me to get lost. At that point I lost it and swore back and tossed the food on the floor and walked out because for me it wasn't about the few pounds, it was the attitude and the immoral behaviour that made me want to walk off before it got nasty. Honestly I would recommend people to stay away from such rogue traders who swear and disrespect customers. Worst experience of my life.
